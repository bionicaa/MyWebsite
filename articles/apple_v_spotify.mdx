# Apple Music vs Spotify: Which is the Better Music Streaming Service?

Let me preface this with me owning an Iphone. 
So I started using Apple Music when it first launched in 2015 and switched to Spotify roughly 2 years ago in 2023. Most spotify users will defend the platform like it is their own child, but in my honest opinion both have their pros and cons. Let me run you through what I love and loathe about each platform to let you decide which is best for you.

Both platforms offer user friendly interfaces and the same core features such as playlists, radio stations, and music discovery. However, Apple Music's interface is more streamlined and integrates seamlessly with other Apple devices, while Spotify offers a more customizable experience with features like collaborative playlists and a wider range of third party integrations. 
For me, Apple Music was great because many apps offer Apple Music integration, like google maps allowing you to control music playback without switching apps. Another reason I enjoyed Apple Music was that I found discovering music much easier due to the clean interface and less overwhelming options. Apple also curate lists of new music based on genre and provide a "For You" section that actually matches your artist taste. You can then add that music to your library or a playlist. 
In Spotify, you can only create playlists, which means when you want to just shuffle random songs you don't have that option. I find the interface more cluttered and overwhelming with too many options, making it harder to discover new music. Plus, Spotify does not integrate into other apps as well as Apple Music does, which can be frustrating for users who want a seamless experience across their devices. 
Ultimately, your user behaviour has to change with each platform to get the most out of it and maybe because I started with Apple Music I found it more intuitive and familiar. 

Eventhough I have so far praised Apple Music, there are some unforgivable downsides in my opinon. Firstly, it is extremly bug prone. There were multiple times when I would be navigating or trying to add songs and the app would freeze or crash. Every now and again these problems would get fixed, but something else would arise and you would be constantly trying to avoid using the app in a certain way to avoid it falling over. 
Spotify on the other hand is seamless. The interface is smooth, responsive and has never encountered any issues. 

When it comes to music library size, both Apple Music and Spotify boast impressive catalogs with over 70 million songs each. However, Spotify has a slight edge in terms of exclusive content and podcasts, making it a more versatile platform for users who enjoy a variety of audio content. Apple Music, on the other hand, focuses more on curated playlists and exclusive album releases from popular artists.
I enjoy listening to podcasts and to have my music in the same place is great, another plus for Spotify.

Which is more affordable? Well, Spotify can be used free of charge with ads, while Apple Music requires a paid subscription. Both platforms offer similar pricing for their premium plans, with individual plans costing $9.99 per month and family plans costing $14.99 per month. However, Spotify offers a student plan for $4.99 per month, which is not available on Apple Music. Additionally, Spotify's free tier allows users to access a limited version of the platform without paying, making it a more budget-friendly option for those who don't want to commit to a subscription. 

I hope you found this comparison informative and helps you decide which music streaming service is the best fit for your listening habits and preferences. Both Apple Music and Spotify have their strengths, so it ultimately comes down to what features matter most to you. Happy listening!
