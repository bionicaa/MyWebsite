# A Full Body Split is the Best Way to Train

After over 15 years of training, lifting weights and playing different sports, I have experimented with many different gym routines. As I have got older, I have unequivocally found that full body splits are the best way to train.

## What is a Full Body Split?
A full body split is a workout routine where you train all major muscle groups in a single session. This incorporating a combination of upper and lower body exercises, ensuring that you work out your entire body multiple times a week.

## Benefits of Full Body Splits
1. **Increased Training Frequency**: By training all muscle groups multiple times a week, you can stimulate muscle growth and strength gains more effectively than with traditional split routines because you are hitting each muscle group more often.
2. **Time Efficiency**: Full body workouts can be completed in a shorter amount of time, making them ideal for those with busy schedules. As I get older and busier, time effective workouts that I can fit in during lunch or before work are essential for allowing me to maintain a consistent routine.
3. **Improved Recovery**: Training all muscle groups in a single session allows for more recovery time between workouts, reducing the risk of overtraining. Additionally, full body workouts can help improve blood circulation, which aids in speeding up muscle recovery and reduces soreness.
4. **Enhanced Functional Fitness**: Full body splits often incorporate compound movements that engage multiple muscle groups, improving overall functional strength and coordination. If you play sports or just want to stay mobile in old age, functional fitness is key.
5. **Balanced Muscle Development**: Full body routines help ensure that no muscle group is neglected, promoting balanced muscle development and reducing the risk of imbalances that can lead to injury. From experience, since shifting to full body splits, I have noticed a significant strength increase, a decrease in small injuries and an overall improvement in my physique.
6. **Flexibility**: Full body workouts can be easily adjusted to fit your goals, whether you're looking to build muscle, lose fat, or improve overall fitness. You can change the exercises, sets, and reps to suit your needs. And that is what training is about... keep it simple, keep it fun!
