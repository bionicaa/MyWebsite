# How to spot an opportunity and identify if it is worth pursuing within your organisation?

We all face problems during our work week. Sometimes, we find these problems are repetitive and slow down our productivity. Some of us choose to accept theses problems as part of the job, while others see them as opportunities to improve processes and add value to the organisation.
With any problem you face, you need to firstly define it and understand what is aggravating about it. Is it causing delays? Is it frustrating to deal with? Is it leading to mistakes? Once you have defined the problem, you can start to think about whether solving this problem would be worth pursuing as an opportunity as you may find that there could be straightforward solution that can be easily implemented.

The key to identifying whether a problem is worth pursuing as an opportunity lies in evaluating its impact and feasibility. Here are some strategies to help you spot these opportunities:

1. **Assess the Impact**: Consider how solving the problem would benefit the organisation. Would it lead to cost savings, increased efficiency, improved customer satisfaction, or enhanced employee morale? Quantifying the potential impact can help you determine if it's worth pursuing.
2. **Evaluate the Feasibility**: Analyze the resources required to address the problem. Do you have the necessary skills, time, and support from colleagues or management? If the solution requires significant investment or expertise that is not readily available, it may not be feasible to pursue.
3. **Seek Feedback**: Discuss the problem with colleagues and stakeholders to gather their perspectives. They may provide insights into the problem's significance and potential solutions that you hadn't considered.
4. **Prototype Solutions**: If possible, test a small-scale solution to see if it effectively addresses the problem. This can help you gauge the practicality of the solution and its potential impact before fully committing to it.
5. **Align with Organisational Goals**: Ensure that the opportunity aligns with the broader goals and objectives of the organisation. If the solution supports strategic initiatives, it is more likely to gain support from management.

In today's fast-paced technologically driven world, organisations are constantly looking at initiatives to continuously improve their processes and products. By proactively identifying and pursuing opportunities to solve problems, you can contribute to the success of your organisation while also advancing your own career. Remember, not every problem will be worth pursuing, but with careful evaluation, you can identify those that have the potential to make a significant impact.

A technique that I like to use when identifying opportunities is the Three Lenses of Innovation. This framework encourages you to view problems and opportunities through three different perspectives: the desirability lens (human needs), the feasibility lens (technical capabilities), and the viability lens (business sustainability). By evaluating a problem through these lenses, you can gain a holistic understanding of its potential and make informed decisions about whether to pursue it as an opportunity.

Ultimately, spotting opportunities within your organisation requires a combination of critical thinking, collaboration, and strategic alignment. By following these strategies and leveraging frameworks like the Three Lenses of Innovation, you can effectively identify and pursue opportunities that drive positive change and contribute to the success of your organisation.
