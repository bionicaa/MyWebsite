# Reaching High Velocity Through Strategic Planning

As you progress through a project, the problems begin to stack up and, before you know it, you are tackling the immediate storms that you are presented with. This can lead to organisations losing sight of the bigger picture and becoming increasingly reactive. This short sighted mindset will make you think you are regaining control, but you will actually experience further delays and internal frustration as things continually take longer than expected. 

Zoom out. Think about what you are trying to deliver and what your end goal is. Use this to inform your strategic planning. By adapting your mindset to better strategise how your project is planned, teams can execute at optimal velocity. 

Once you have defined your goals and established some milestones, you can start to work backwards from your intended deliver date. This will help you identify any potential roadblocks and ensure that you are allocating resources effectively to meet your deadlines. Another benefit will be that you can identify dependencies between tasks and ensure that they are completed in the correct order. Moreover, this approach will help you adapt to any risks that arise as you progress through the project. This is where teams can really start to thrive and deliver value at pace.

With a clear strategic plan, teams are enabled to focus on delivering tasks that align with the business objectives. This clarity helps to reduce distractions and ensures that everyone is working towards the same goals. As a result, teams can work more efficiently and effectively, leading to increased productivity and faster delivery times. Stakeholders become more engaged as the resultant outcome shows higher revenue projections or cost savings, which in turn builds confidence in the team's ability to deliver.

In conclusion, strategic planning is essential for achieving high velocity in project delivery. By taking a step back to define goals, establish milestones, and work backwards from the intended deliver date, teams can identify potential roadblocks, allocate resources effectively, and adapt to risks. This approach enables teams to focus on delivering value at pace, leading to increased productivity and stakeholder engagement. Embrace strategic planning to unlock your team's full potential and achieve success in your projects.
