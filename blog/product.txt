12:T4cf,Early on after starting my career as a software engineer, I quickly realised that I was far more interested in what was involved around building products and how to make them successful, rather than the technical aspects of software development. Although I am grateful to have been an engineer and understand what is required for successful software development, I knew that I wanted to transition into product management.
In 2023, I was sat in a lab at work, frustrated at not being able to find opportunities that would allow me to transition into a product role. That is when I came across an advertisement for a Product Management Career Accelerator Course. The course was being run by King's College London, which is the university I graduated from, so I was instantly curious.
The course was 6 months long, would require around 10-15 hours each week and was designed to provide practical experience in product management. It would be taught by industry professionals, whom would provide guidance and feedback on our work.
My first thoughts were positive, I could fit this into my weekends, it was a structured program I could follow and I'd get a certification from a reputable university. Then came the price... £5,400. 11:[["$","h1",null,{"style":{"fontSize":"2.8rem","fontWeight":700,"letterSpacing":"-0.03em","marginInline":"0.1rem","fontFamily":"Inter, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif","color":"white","borderBottom":"2px solid grey","display":"inline-block","width":"auto","paddingBottom":"0.3rem"},"children":"How Impactful has the Product Management Career Accelerator Course been on my Career?"}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"style":{"fontSize":"1.05rem","fontFamily":"Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif","color":"#ddd","margin":"0.7rem","lineHeight":1.2},"children":["$12",["$","em",null,{"children":"Gulp"}],".

Well, the course also provided career support including resume reviews, interview preparation and advice on job searching. This was great to help me clean up my personal brand and prepare me to apply for roles.\r\nWith that support, I applied to many roles and secured some interviews... but didn't receive any offers. Several months passed and I still hadn't found a role. I got to the stage of accepting that the course wouldn't result in a new job and I would just have to live with the cost of trying something bold.\r\nWith my new found knowledge and skills, I decided to ask my current company to fund some Agile Scrum certifications which I passed! This showed my company that I was serious about agile product development and had the knowledge to back it up.\r\n",["$","img",null,{"src":"images/professional-scrum-master-i-psm-i.png","alt":"PSM"}]," ",["$","img",null,{"src":"images/professional-scrum-product-owner-i-pspo-i.png","alt":"PSPO"}]]}]

20:T64d,Then I saw an opportunity within my project. I developed a business case to improve our software release procedure by introducing automation into the system architecture. I developed a prototype and presented this to senior managment, justifying the cost and time benefits the solution would bring. They agreed and I was given the opportunity to lead the project as a Product Owner/Scrum Master. This was my first real product role and I was able to apply many of the skills I had learned on the course.
Because of the successful delivery of this project and the value it brought to the business, I was promoted! This began my transition into a full-time Product role.
After another year, I was able to get promoted again as a Product Owner of a larger project in my company. All in all, my salary increased more than the cost of the course in a couple years. Could I have achieved this without doing the course? Possibly, but I do believe the course provided me with the drive and confidence to go after what I wanted from my career.
Looking back now I can say it was worth doing and it has definitely helped me in my career. But I don't think everyone needs to go down this route as I think professional experience will be far more valuable if it is available to you. It wasn't until I took it upon myself to action what I had learnt and prove my value within my organisation that I was able to push into a product role.
Regardless, follow your gut and take the leap if you are hungry for change. Nothing comes easy, but with a little patience and a lot of persistence we can all get to where we want to be.1f:["$","p",null,{"style":{"fontSize":"1.05rem","fontFamily":"Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif","color":"#ddd","margin":"0.7rem","lineHeight":1.2},"children":"$20"}]
