12:T5a7,Both platforms offer user friendly interfaces and the same core features such as playlists, radio stations, and music discovery. However, Apple Music's interface is more streamlined and integrates seamlessly with other Apple devices, while Spotify offers a more customizable experience with features like collaborative playlists and a wider range of third party integrations.
For me, Apple Music was great because many apps offer Apple Music integration, like google maps allowing you to control music playback without switching apps. Another reason I enjoyed Apple Music was that I found discovering music much easier due to the clean interface and less overwhelming options. Apple also curate lists of new music based on genre and provide a "For You" section that actually matches your artist taste. You can then add that music to your library or a playlist.
In Spotify, you can only create playlists, which means when you want to just shuffle random songs you don't have that option. I find the interface more cluttered and overwhelming with too many options, making it harder to discover new music. Plus, Spotify does not integrate into other apps as well as Apple Music does, which can be frustrating for users who want a seamless experience across their devices.
Ultimately, your user behaviour has to change with each platform to get the most out of it and maybe because I started with Apple Music I found it more intuitive and familiar.11:[["$","h1",null,{"style":{"fontSize":"2.8rem","fontWeight":700,"letterSpacing":"-0.03em","marginInline":"0.1rem","fontFamily":"Inter, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif","color":"white","borderBottom":"2px solid grey","display":"inline-block","width":"auto","marginRight":"10rem","paddingRight":"10rem","paddingBottom":"0.7rem"},"children":"Apple Music vs Spotify: Which is the Better Music Streaming Service?"}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"style":{"fontSize":"1.05rem","fontFamily":"Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif","color":"#ddd","marginBottom":"3.3rem","marginRight":"10rem","paddingRight":"10rem","lineHeight":1.2},"children":"Let me preface this with me owning an Iphone.\r\nSo I started using Apple Music when it first launched in 2015 and switched to Spotify roughly 2 years ago in 2023.

However, Spotify offers a student plan for $4.99 per month, which is not available on Apple Music. Additionally, Spotify's free tier allows users to access a limited version of the platform without paying, making it a more budget-friendly option for those who don't want to commit to a subscription."}]
